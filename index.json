Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 62.51 seconds A few Google searches finds me a vulnerability involving “fingerd” towards username enumeration on Solaris systems. https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/finger-solaris-user-enumeration Some more searching leads me to a Perl script we can use to enumerate usernames. We’ll download it using wget. **wget** [**https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/finger-user-enum/master/finger-user-enum.pl**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/finger-user-enum/master/finger-user-enum.pl) ```![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hEoObsS7-7XbUjCqzxIJGw.png)``` Usage: finger-user-enum.pl \\[options\\] ( -u username | -U file-of-usernames ) ( -t host | -T file-of-targets )Examples:\\\\$ finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 10.0.0.1 \\\\$ finger-user-enum.pl -u root -t 10.0.0.1 \\\\$ finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -T ips.txt A quick “locate username” on my Kali machine pulls all the files containing the word username. **locate username** /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt sounds good to me with an advertised “10 million!” usernames… Quick preview Using this file, our syntax in our working directory will be: **perl finger-user-enum.pl -U /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -t 10.10.10.76 \u003e userenum.txt** The scripts output will append the results to a file named userenum.txt. (You do not have to do this, I just don’t like to lose my results.) The output is a bit messy, but we have a few usernames to attempt a brute-force attack against port [22022/tcp open ssh SunSSH 1.3 (protocol 2.0)] The following usernames are the most interesting: sammy@10.10.10.76: sammy console \u003cJul 31 17:59\u003e sunny@10.10.10.76: sunny pts/3 \u003cApr 24, 2018\u003e Use the following syntax to brute-force: **hydra -V -f -t 4 -l sunny -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/sunday/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/sunday/"}]
